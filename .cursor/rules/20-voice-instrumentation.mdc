- When implementing turn detection, always emit OBS-00 events:
  vad.state_changed, eou.prediction, endpointing.delay_applied, turn.started.
- Ensure user-facing delay acknowledgements emit ux.delay_acknowledged.
- Never regress barge-in behavior: tts.stopped cause="barge_in" must be emitted.
- Keep spoken UX Dutch and non-technical (VC-00).
